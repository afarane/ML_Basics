ML Models:

1. Linear Regression -- (Supervised)

2. Logistic Regression (For Classification ) (Supervised)

3. Decision Tree & Random Forest (For Classification & Regression) (Supervised)

4. PCA -- (Unsupervised)

5. KNN -- (For Classification & Regression)

6. K-Means (For Classification & Regression)  Discriminative model (Unsupervised)
- Distributon is based on Distance 
[ Ref: https://www.datascience.com/blog/k-means-clustering ]

Hirarchical Clustering :
- Agglomerative (Bottom-up clustering Method)
- Divisive (Top-down clustering Method )

7. Naive Bayes (For Classification) - Probability Distribution Generative model . Good fit for Text based analysis (Supervised)

Heighlights:
- Needs less data (Sparse data)
- Scalable
- Fast
- Handles Continuous and Discrete data


Applications:
- Face Recognition
- Email Spam Filter
- Categorize News

8. SVM (Supervised)

SVMs can be used to do two things: classification or regression.
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is used for regression

When to use? :
- To avoid curse of dimensionality. 
- When you have many outliers 
- Robust

Where to use? :
- Sparse data
- High Dimensional data
- Text Classification
- Data is nonlinear
- Image classification
- Data has complex patterns
